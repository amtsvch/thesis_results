     * loader unless it loaded this class (StandardJarScanner) or is a parent
     * of the class loader that loaded this class.
     *
     * This should mean:
     *   the webapp class loader is an application class loader
     *   the shared class loader is an application class loader
     *   the server class loader is not an application class loader
     *   the common class loader is not an application class loader
     *   the system class loader is not an application class loader
     *   the bootstrap class loader is not an application class loader
