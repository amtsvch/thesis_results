/**
 * Constructs a cookie with a specified name and value.
 * <p>
 * The name must conform to RFC 2109. That means it can contain only ASCII
 * alphanumeric characters and cannot contain commas, semicolons, or white
 * space or begin with a $ character. The cookie's name cannot be changed
 * after creation.
 * <p>
 * The value can be anything the server chooses to send. Its value is
 * probably of interest only to the server. The cookie's value can be
 * changed after creation with the <code>setValue</code> method.
 * <p>
 * By default, cookies are created according to the Netscape cookie
 * specification. The version can be changed with the
 * <code>setVersion</code> method.
 *
 * @param name
 *            a <code>String</code> specifying the name of the cookie
 * @param value
 *            a <code>String</code> specifying the value of the cookie
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException
 *             if the cookie name contains illegal characters (for example,
 *             a comma, space, or semicolon) or it is one of the tokens
 *             reserved for use by the cookie protocol
