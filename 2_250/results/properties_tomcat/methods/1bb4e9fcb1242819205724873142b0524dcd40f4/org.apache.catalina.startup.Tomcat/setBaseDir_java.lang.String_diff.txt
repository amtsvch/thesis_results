/**
 * Tomcat requires that the base directory is set because the defaults for
 * a number of other locations, such as the work directory, are derived from
 * the base directory. This should be the first method called.
 * <p>
 * If this method is not called then Tomcat will attempt to use these
 * locations in the following order:
 * <ol>
 *  <li>if set, the catalina.base system property</li>
 *  <li>if set, the catalina.home system property</li>
 *  <li>The user.dir system property (the directory where Java was run from)
 *      where a directory named tomcat.$PORT will be created. $PORT is the
 *      value configured via {@link #setPort(int)} which defaults to 8080 if
 *      not set</li>
 * </ol>
 * The user should ensure that the file permissions for the base directory
 * are appropriate.
 * <p>
 * TODO: disable work dir if not needed ( no jsp, etc ).
 *
 * @param basedir The Tomcat base folder on which all others will be derived
