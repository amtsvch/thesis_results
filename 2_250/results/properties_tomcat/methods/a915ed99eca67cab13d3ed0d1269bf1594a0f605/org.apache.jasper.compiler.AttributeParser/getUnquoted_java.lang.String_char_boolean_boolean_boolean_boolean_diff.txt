/**
 * Parses the provided input String as a JSP attribute and returns an
 * unquoted value.
 *
 * @param input         The input.
 * @param quote         The quote character for the attribute or 0 for
 *                      scripting expressions.
 * @param isELIgnored   Is expression language being ignored on the page
 *                      where the JSP attribute is defined.
 * @param isDeferredSyntaxAllowedAsLiteral
 *                      Are deferred expressions treated as literals?
 * @param strict        Should the rules of JSP.1.6 for escaping of quotes
 *                      be strictly applied?
 * @param quoteAttributeEL Should the rules of JSP.1.6 for escaping in
 *                      attributes be applied to EL in attribute values?
 * @return              An unquoted JSP attribute that, if it contains
 *                      expression language can be safely passed to the EL
 *                      processor without fear of ambiguity.
