/**
 * Creates a Base64 codec used for decoding (all modes) and encoding in URL-unsafe mode.
 * <p>
 * When encoding the line length is given in the constructor, the line separator is CRLF, and the encoding table is
 * STANDARD_ENCODE_TABLE.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Line lengths that aren't multiples of 4 will still essentially end up being multiples of 4 in the encoded data.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When decoding all variants are supported.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param lineLength
 *            Each line of encoded data will be at most of the given length (rounded down to nearest multiple of
 *            4). If lineLength &lt;= 0, then the output will not be divided into lines (chunks). Ignored when
 *            decoding.
 * @since 1.4
